This is the first post on the new, static TechGirlGeek site. Thank you for taking the time to look around. We are starting at the very beginning, since our old content is long out of date. Please stay tuned for more Ansible related links and information coming in the near future as we rebuild the TechGirlGeek brand.

As an avid fan of Ansible, and Red Hat as a whole, much of the content will be around the technologies surrounding both. However, we do reserve the right to sprinkle in other cool technology subjects as we deem fit for your consumption.
